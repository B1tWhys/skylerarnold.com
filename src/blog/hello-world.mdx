import { Picture } from 'astro:assets'
import testImage from './test_image_nyc.jpg'

This is my first blogpost! What else is there to do but test out all the nifty features
I've just spent the last few hours configuring.

My favorite thing is how code blocks look, courtesy of [Expressive Code](https://expressive-code.com/):

```python
# breadth_first_search.py
def bfs(nodes, start):
  q = deque([start])
  while q:
    cur = q.popleft()
    print(cur.value)
    q.extend(cur.children.values())
```

> Here's a block quote

And I think I should even be able to use some mdx to define a list easily:
<ol class="list-decimal">
{
    ["foo", "bar", "baz"].map((x) => <li>{x}</li>)
}
</ol>

Astro also has some pretty slick features for image handling. I handed it a `4368x2912` png image,
and I think it's going to downsample it to the correct size, and setup the html with the reactive attributes
so that the right version shows up:
<Picture src={testImage}
      alt="A test image"
      widths={[240, 540, 720, testImage.width]}
      sizes={`(max-width: 360px) 240px, (max-width: 720px) 540px, (max-width: 1600px) 720px, ${testImage.width}`} />
