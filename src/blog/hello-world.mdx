This is my first blogpost! What else there to do but test out all the nifty features
I've just spent the last few hours configuring.

My favorite thing is how code blocks look, courtesy of [Expressive Code](https://expressive-code.com/):

```python
# breadth_first_search.py
def bfs(nodes, start):
  q = deque([start])
  while q:
    cur = q.popleft()
    print(cur.value)
    q.extend(cur.children.values())
```

> Here's a block quote

And I think I should even be able to use some mdx to define a list easily:
<ol class="list-decimal">
{
    ["foo", "bar", "baz"].map((x) => <li>{x}</li>)
}
</ol>
