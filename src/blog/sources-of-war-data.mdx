I was having a hard time comparing data sources listed in [this Our World in Data article](https://ourworldindata.org/conflict-data-how-do-researchers-measure-armed-conflicts-and-their-deaths)
 (there's a lot of scrolling the way they laid things out). So I made a table that just condenses the info I need:

import SourcesTable from "../components/blog/sources-of-war-data/SourcesTable.tsx"

<SourcesTable />
